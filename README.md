1. Introduction / Background

The dataset that I am using is an Amazon Reviews dataset. What I am wanting to do with it is to make a LLM that will find what rating a user gave a product based on the review they gave. This is a text classification becuase it is taking the reviews a user wrote and it will try and classify it based on key words and try and learn the rating given.
